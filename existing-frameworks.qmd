## NIH Proficiency Scale

@NIH_competencies_2017

> The NIH Proficiency Scale is an instrument used to measure one’s ability to demonstrate a competency on the job. The scale captures a wide range of ability levels and organizes them into five steps; from “Fundamental Awareness” to “Expert”.

|                   Term                  | Translation EN/DE | Definition | Comments |
|:---------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| Fundamental Awareness (basic knowledge) |                   | common knowledge or an understanding of basic techniques and concepts. | Focus on learning |
| Novice (limited experience)             |                   | level of experience gained in a classroom and/or experimental scenarios or as a trainee on-the-job. | Expected to need help when performing this skill; Focus on developing through on-the-job experience; understand and can discuss terminology, concepts, principles and issues related to this competency; utilize the full range of reference and resource materials in this competency. |
| Intermediate (practical application)    |                   | ability to successfully complete tasks in this competency as requested    | Help from an expert may be required from time to time, but you can usually perform the skill independently; Focus is on applying and enhancing knowledge or skill; You have applied this competency to situations occasionally while needing minimal guidance to perform successfully; You understand and can discuss the application and implications of changes to processes, policies, and procedures in this area.
 |
| Advanced (applied theory) |  | perform the actions associated with this skill without assistance | You are certainly recognized within your immediate organization as "a person to ask" when difficult questions arise regarding this skill; Focus is on broad organizational/professional issues; You have consistently provided practical/relevant ideas and perspectives on process or practice improvements which may easily be implemented; You are capable of coaching others in the application of this competency by translating complex nuances relating to this competency into easy to understand terms; You participate in senior level discussions regarding this competency; You assist in the development of reference and resource materials in this competency.
 |
| Expert (recognized authority) |  | known as an expert in this area | You can provide guidance, troubleshoot and answer questions related to this area of expertise and the field where the skill is used; Focus is strategic; You have demonstrated consistent excellence in applying this competency across multiple projects and/or organizations; You are considered the “go to” person in this area within NIH and/or outside organizations; You create new applications for and/or lead the development of reference and resource materials for this competency; You are able to diagram or explain the relevant process elements and issues in relation to organizational issues and trends in sufficient detail during discussions and presentations, to foster a greater understanding among internal and external colleagues and constituents.

 The competencies are divided into four sections:
 
- **Non-Technical**: These are fundamental competencies such as “Communication” and “Leveraging Technology” which can be applied across administrative positions.  
- **Technical**: These competencies represent the skill sets required for specific functional areas.  
- **Leadership & Management**: Represent the essential competencies necessary to be a successful leader or manager.  
- **Executive Proficiencies**: These proficiencies are designed to identify the skill sets of the top levels of management and can be used as a guide for individuals aspiring to reach these positions (e.g., IC Director, Deputy IC Director, Scientific Director, Extramural Director, or Executive Officer).  

Some sections have subgroups for special fields of application and a list of competencies, e.g. Accountability, Adaptability, Advisory Assistance, Attention to Detail. Change Management, Collaboration, Communications, Continuous Improvement, which are described in detail and precisely in individual sections.

### Example: Competence *Data Gathering and Analysis* {.unnumbered}

Seeks or collects and synthesizes information from a variety of stakeholders and sources in an objective, unbiased manner to reach a conclusion, goal, or judgment, and to enable strategic and leadership decision making.

#### Key Behaviors {.unnumbered}

-   Uses knowledge of data, systems, and their intersections to provide workforce information from the most applicable data source/s in response to standard or ad hoc requests and in support of data quality checks.
-   Performs historical trending and projection analyses as appropriate for strategic needs.
-   Meets with customers to understand their needs or concerns in order to ensure data, analytics, and reporting are used appropriately.
-   Leverages external networks to ensure all relevant information is integrated into analysis and interpretation of data.
-   Conducts ad hoc and standard analyses in response to customer needs, incorporating knowledge of parallel, ongoing projects into analysis for customers.
-   Analyzes data in order to draw conclusions and identify cause and effect relationships to support leadership decisions, recommend a course of action, or solve organizational issues.
-   Uses knowledge and understanding of the organizational context to recognize data inaccuracies and to ensure consistency and the highest quality of data and analyses.
-   Organizes and develops data to respond to audits and data calls for NIH.
-   Identifies issues, problems, or opportunities and determines if action is needed.
-   Gathers, compiles, and interprets pertinent data using various data collection techniques.
-   Clearly documents sources and validates the accuracy of data/information to resolve inconsistencies.
-   Analyzes and investigates up-to-date information from various sources and in various formats.
-   Seeks additional resources when gaps and inconsistencies or variances in data are found.
-   Identifies trends in data.
-   Understands and analyzes information.

## Future Skills

@schuller_future_2019
The Framework "Future Skills: Ein Framework für Data Literacy" is an attempt to define a model for the structured description of behaviour(s) when working with data.

In appendix C, the authors provide a differentiated Data Literacy Framework, which is divided into several "fields" of competency ("*Kompetenzfelder*"):

-   A: Establishing a data culture - from system to measurable object
-   B: Providing data - from measurable objects to data
-   C: Analyzing data - From data to data products
-   D: Interpreting data products - From data products to data
-   E: Interpret data - From data to measurable objects
-   F: Derive action - From measurable objects to the system

These "fields" each contain several Competencies that are defined in the framework. Each Competency again is divided into three "dimensions" ("*Kompetenzdimensionen*") - Knowledge - Skills - Attitude

Furthermore, each Competency is provided with examples for levels of competency ("*Kompetenzniveaus*"), although these are - in contrast to other frameworks - not specifically defined or named (such as "Novice" or "Expert").
