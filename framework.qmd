# Framework structure and components

![infographics](figs/infographics.png)
This Research Data Management Competency Framework is derived from existing and established frameworks (see reference sources), but was developed specifically for the NFDI4Objects consortium's expert domain, namely data from the research and conservation of material heritage.

### Existing Frameworks

|:---------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| Fundamental Awareness (basic knowledge) |                   | common knowledge or an understanding of basic techniques and concepts. | Focus on learning |
| Novice (limited experience)             |                   | level of experience gained in a classroom and/or experimental scenarios or as a trainee on-the-job. | Expected to need help when performing this skill; Focus on developing through on-the-job experience; understand and can discuss terminology, concepts, principles and issues related to this competency; utilize the full range of reference and resource materials in this competency. |
| Intermediate (practical application)    |                   | ability to successfully complete tasks in this competency as requested    | Help from an expert may be required from time to time, but you can usually perform the skill independently; Focus is on applying and enhancing knowledge or skill; You have applied this competency to situations occasionally while needing minimal guidance to perform successfully; You understand and can discuss the application and implications of changes to processes, policies, and procedures in this area.
 |
| Advanced (applied theory) |  | perform the actions associated with this skill without assistance | You are certainly recognized within your immediate organization as "a person to ask" when difficult questions arise regarding this skill; Focus is on broad organizational/professional issues; You have consistently provided practical/relevant ideas and perspectives on process or practice improvements which may easily be implemented; You are capable of coaching others in the application of this competency by translating complex nuances relating to this competency into easy to understand terms; You participate in senior level discussions regarding this competency; You assist in the development of reference and resource materials in this competency.
 |
| Expert (recognized authority) |  | known as an expert in this area | You can provide guidance, troubleshoot and answer questions related to this area of expertise and the field where the skill is used; Focus is strategic; You have demonstrated consistent excellence in applying this competency across multiple projects and/or organizations; You are considered the “go to” person in this area within NIH and/or outside organizations; You create new applications for and/or lead the development of reference and resource materials for this competency; You are able to diagram or explain the relevant process elements and issues in relation to organizational issues and trends in sufficient detail during discussions and presentations, to foster a greater understanding among internal and external colleagues and constituents.

 The competencies are divided into four sections:
- Non-Technical: These are foundational competencies such as “Communication” and “Leveraging Technology” which can be applied across administrative positions.
- Technical: These competencies represent the skill sets required for specific functional areas.
- Leadership & Management: Represent the essential competencies necessary to be a successful leader or manager.
- Executive Proficiencies: These proficiencies are designed to identify the skill sets of the top levels of management and can be used as a guide for individuals aspiring to reach these positions (e.g., IC Director, Deputy IC Director, Scientific Director, Extramural Director, or Executive Officer).

Some section have subgroups for special fields of application and a list of competencies, e.g. Accountability, Adaptability, Advisory Assistance, Attention to Detail. Change Management, Collaboration, Communications, Continuous Improvement, which are described in detail and precisely in individual sections.

### Example: Competence *Data Gathering and Analysis*

Seeks or collects and synthesizes information from a variety of stakeholders and sources in an objective, unbiased manner to reach a conclusion, goal, or judgment, and to enable strategic and leadership decision making.

#### Key Behaviors 

-   Uses knowledge of data, systems, and their intersections to provide workforce information from the most applicable data source/s in response to standard or ad hoc requests and in support of data quality checks.
-   Performs historical trending and projection analyses as appropriate for strategic needs.
-   Meets with customers to understand their needs or concerns in order to ensure data, analytics, and reporting are used appropriately.
-   Leverages external networks to ensure all relevant information is integrated into analysis and interpretation of data.
-   Conducts ad hoc and standard analyses in response to customer needs, incorporating knowledge of parallel, ongoing projects into analysis for customers.
-   Analyzes data in order to draw conclusions and identify cause and effect relationships to support leadership decisions, recommend a course of action, or solve organizational issues.
-   Uses knowledge and understanding of the organizational context to recognize data inaccuracies and to ensure consistency and the highest quality of data and analyses.
-   Organizes and develops data to respond to audits and data calls for NIH.
-   Identifies issues, problems, or opportunities and determines if action is needed.
-   Gathers, compiles, and interprets pertinent data using various data collection techniques.
-   Clearly documents sources and validates the accuracy of data/information to resolve inconsistencies.
-   Analyzes and investigates up-to-date information from various sources and in various formats.
-   Seeks additional resources when gaps and inconsistencies or variances in data are found.
-   Identifies trends in data.
-   Understands and analyzes information.

## NFDI4Objects Competency Framework




The framework is a practical tool to enable research data management practitioners, instructors and managers:

- to identify required data management role competencies and proficiency levels (required competency profile);
- to identify employees’ current data management competencies and proficiency levels (actual competency profile);
- to map the gaps that exist between required and actual competency profiles; and
- to draft competency development plans at individual, team, department, division and organizational levels.

The Framework is structured around four competency areas or “pillars” reflecting the four distinct stages of the data lifecycle management. Within each competency area are competency domains (**??** in total), which are a set of distinct sub-competencies for each competency area. Within each domain, the Framework sets out the three competency dimensions (subject **knowledge**, practical **skills** and personal **attitudes**), which are the determinants of overall **competence**.

Each domain contains **five** designated proficiency **levels** (ranging from learner-beginner to master-expert practitioner), which describe the incremental levels of proficiency by reference to a set of described technical–professional tasks that are specific, measurable and role relevant and which will determine the level of proficiency achieved by an individual or required for a specific position.

## Areas
