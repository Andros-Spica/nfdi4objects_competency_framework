### Competency types - *Kompetenzarten*

The competencies are divided into four sections:
 
- **Non-Technical**: These are fundamental competencies such as “Communication” and “Leveraging Technology” which can be applied across administrative positions.  
- **Technical**: These competencies represent the skill sets required for specific functional areas.  
- **Leadership & Management**: Represent the essential competencies necessary to be a successful leader or manager.  
- **Executive Proficiencies**: These proficiencies are designed to identify the skill sets of the top levels of management and can be used as a guide for individuals aspiring to reach these positions (e.g., IC Director, Deputy IC Director, Scientific Director, Extramural Director, or Executive Officer).  

Some sections have subgroups for special fields of application and a list of competencies, e.g. Accountability, Adaptability, Advisory Assistance, Attention to Detail. Change Management, Collaboration, Communications, Continuous Improvement, which are described in detail and precisely in individual sections.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
#### Example: Competence *Data Gathering and Analysis* {.unnumbered}

Seeks or collects and synthesizes information from a variety of stakeholders and sources in an objective, unbiased manner to reach a conclusion, goal, or judgment, and to enable strategic and leadership decision making.

## WHO Data Management Competency Framework

@who-dmcf

>The Framework is designed around the **four core stages of the data management cycle**: **data generation**, **processing**, **analysis** and **usage**. Within the Framework, these stages are classified as **competency areas**, and within these four competency areas, a further **17 competency domains** have been identified. These domains are effectively sets of sub-competencies within the wider competency areas. The Framework provides users with **detailed domain definitions** and **specific descriptors of the technical knowledge and skill sets** covered within each domain. The Framework further provides and describes **four proficiency levels**, i.e. levels of competence within each domain, and describes the technical knowledge and skills that determine the achievement of each proficiency level. This is rounded out by **attitudinal domains** that describes behaviours and mindsets that are essential for long-term sustainable capacity-building."  
>(p. vii-viii, emphasis added)

![Structure of WHO Data Management Competency Framework (Fig. 2)](figs/WHO-framework.png)

### Proficency levels

| Level | Classification | Proficiency level descriptors |
|:---:|:-------:|:--------------------------------------|
| 1 | Learner-Beginner | A graduate-level employee who has just entered the health information workforce and appointed to their first role. Has a level of theoretical knowledge and some practical experience, but this has been acquired in a “controlled-learning” college setting. Because of this, practically oriented work and task-completion experience is very limited, and the employee requires supervised, delegated, on-the-job incremental tasks with regular coaching and feedback. |
| 2 | Novice Practitioner | Has been in the role for one year or more and is developing competency across relevant role domains but continues to work under supervision and oversight on all but most basic delegated professional tasks. |
| 3 | Independent Practitioner | Is independently and reliably competent in the specific domain. Rarely is there a need to refer for advice or guidance – only in unique or exceptional situations. |
| 4 | Master Practitioner | Has achieved mastery in the domain. Is an acknowledged expert and expands the boundaries of domain knowledge through research, experimentation and innovation. Is recognized as a trainer and mentor to juniors and is sought after by peers and others for technical advice and guidance. |

### Definitions on *knowledge* and *skill* dimensions

Within each competency domain, grouped per competency area, a bullet-point definition of the expected knowledge and skills at each proficiency level. Requirements are noted to be cumulative; i.e. a proficiency level requires all knowledge and skills required at lower levels.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
### Example: Competency Area 1 *Data Generation* - Domain 1 *Data management planning* - Level 2 Novice Practicioner {.unnumbered}

#### Description {.unnumbered}

>**Data management planning** is the process of delivering a formal written document (*data management plan*) that describes the process and methodology by which data will be created, collected and maintained throughout the life cycle of a proposed survey, trial or research activity and beyond (4–6). Factors of relevance and concern include data source identification and validation, data quality assurance and control, selection of data types (primary, secondary, tertiary), appropriate collection methodology and data maintenance (see Domain 4 below).  
>(p. 7, emphasis added)

#### Novice Practicioner {.unnumbered}

**Knowledge dimension**:

In addition to the Learner-Beginner knowledge, be able to describe and explain:

- The factors that influence and determine the design of data collection instruments and data presentation tools and techniques (for example, the audience, the nature of the data, whether to store in a structured or unstructured manner)  
- Inherent risks within the overall data collection process  
- The expected contents, structure and core elements of a data management plan (for example, the what and the how of data collection, application of the data management cycle)  
- The organizational process of escalating identified data security risks  

*(Learner-Beginner requirements)*

- What a data management plan (or adapted term for localized use) is  
- The purpose, role and importance of a data management plan in the data-generation process  
- Why data are organizational assets and why data security risks should be monitored and mitigated  
- The critical limitations of data  
- The core International Organization for Standardization (ISO) data standards and data management planning principles  
- The most common risks associated with data  
- How and under what circumstances identified data risks should be escalated through the risk management structure

**Skills dimension**:

In addition to the Learner-Beginner skills, be able to do the following:

- Draft a basic data management plan based on a provided template  
- Identify data risks in a provided data management plan and draft a basic risk removal/mitigation plan to address them  
- Design basic data collection instruments and presentation tools and techniques  
- Initiate an appropriate data security risk escalation process

*(Learner-Beginner requirements)*

- Identify any missing key information in a data request (for example, target population) and know when to seek further clarification  
- Identify where ISO data standards and data management planning principles have been applied (or not) in a sample data management plan  
- Categorize the levels of potential value and utilization of different data types and datasets based on the identified limitations of the data provided  
- Recognize and categorize different data types and datasets in ascending order of value to the organization (D/C/B/A – low, medium, high, mission essential)  
- Categorize different data types and datasets in ascending order of risk to the organization (D/C/B/A – low, medium, high, mission threatening)

:::

### Attitudes

The WHO Competency Framework also defines a set of attitudes that should be awarded to improve **professionalism** (p. 50-51):

- **Curiosity**  
- **Commitment**  
- **Collaboration**  
- **Compliance**  

Those are, however, related to a more general work ethic rather than particularly to data management. This inclusion does raise an important point: should an attitude dimension be considered when defining a RDM competency framework within the disciplinary domain of NFDI4Objects?

### Framework application for profile definition

Given the framework definitions, the profile for a position and/or graduate can be defined by stating which intersection of area-domain and level are required, accounting for both specific knowledge and skills as well as attitudes, more generally.

## Future Skills

@schuller_future_2019
The Framework "Future Skills: Ein Framework für Data Literacy" is an attempt to define a model for the structured description of behaviour(s) when working with data.

In appendix C, the authors provide a differentiated Data Literacy Framework, which is divided into several "fields" of competency ("*Kompetenzfelder*"):

-   A: Establishing a data culture - from system to measurable object
-   B: Providing data - from measurable objects to data
-   C: Analyzing data - From data to data products
-   D: Interpreting data products - From data products to data
-   E: Interpret data - From data to measurable objects
-   F: Derive action - From measurable objects to the system

These "fields" each contain several Competencies that are defined in the framework. Each Competency again is divided into three "dimensions" ("*Kompetenzdimensionen*") - Knowledge - Skills - Attitude

Furthermore, each Competency is provided with examples for levels of competency ("*Kompetenzniveaus*"), although these are - in contrast to other frameworks - not specifically defined or named (such as "Novice" or "Expert").

### Learning levels

1. *Remembering/Knowledge*: Accessing relevant knowledge in long-term memory;  
2. *Understanding*: Assigning meaning to information in the learning unit, whether oral, written or graphic;  
3. *Apply*: Perform or use a course of action (a scheme, a method) in a given situation;  
4. *Analyse*: Break down learning content into its constructed elements and determine how they are interconnected to form an overarching structure or purpose;  
5. *Judge*: Make judgements based on criteria or standards;  
6. *Create*: Putting elements together into a coherent or functioning whole; assembling elements into a new pattern or structure.  

### Matrix structure

- **Columns**: the qualification levels from Bachelor's to Master's and PhD to Data Stewards;  
- **Rows**: the individual learning objectives;
- **Groups of rows**: the topic clusters and topics.

>In order to avoid redundancies, the learning objectives of the lower qualification levels are not listed again in the higher ones. Thus, for the qualification level "PhD", not only the learning objectives listed in the column "PhD" are relevant, but also those listed in the columns "Master" and "Bachelor".
