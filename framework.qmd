# Framework structure and components

![infographics](figs/infographics.png)
This Research Data Management Competency Framework is derived from existing and established frameworks (see reference sources), but was developed specifically for the NFDI4Objects consortium's expert domain, namely data from the research and conservation of material heritage.

## Overview

The framework is a practical tool to enable research data management practitioners, instructors and managers:

- to identify required data management role competencies and proficiency levels (required competency profile);
- to identify employees’ current data management competencies and proficiency levels (actual competency profile);
- to map the gaps that exist between required and actual competency profiles; and
- to draft competency development plans at individual, team, department, division and organizational levels.

The Framework is structured around four competency areas or “pillars” reflecting the four distinct stages of the data lifecycle management. Within each competency area are competency domains (**??** in total), which are a set of distinct sub-competencies for each competency area. Within each domain, the Framework sets out the three competency dimensions (subject **knowledge**, practical **skills** and personal **attitudes**), which are the determinants of overall **competence**.

Each domain contains **five** designated proficiency **levels** (ranging from learner-beginner to master-expert practitioner), which describe the incremental levels of proficiency by reference to a set of described technical–professional tasks that are specific, measurable and role relevant and which will determine the level of proficiency achieved by an individual or required for a specific position.

## Levels

### Learner-Beginner
>Fundamental awareness. You have a common knowledge or an understanding of basic techniques and concepts.

>You assist in the development of reference and resource materials in this competency.

### Master-Expert
>You are known as an expert in this area. You can provide guidance, troubleshoot and answer questions related to this area of expertise and the field where the skill is used.

>Focus is strategic;
>You have demonstrated consistent excellence in applying this competency across multiple projects and/or organizations;
>You are considered the “go to” person in this area within NIH and/or outside organizations;
>You create new applications for and/or lead the development of reference and resource materials for this competency;
>You are able to diagram or explain the relevant process elements and issues in relation to organizational issues and trends in sufficient detail during discussions and presentations, to foster a greater understanding among internal and external colleagues and constituents.
